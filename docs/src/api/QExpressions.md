# QExpressions

The `QExpressions` module provides the symbolic quantum expressions built on top of the operator and state spaces defined in `statespace`.  
Expressions can represent single operator terms, sums of terms, indexed sums over subsystems, and full differential equations.

QAlgebra organizes expressions into:

- Core struct types
- Functions for constructing and simplifying expressions
- Pretty-printing functions for strings and LaTeX output
- Algebraic operations like commutators and symbolic sums

## Expression Types
We define the abstract types:
```@docs
QObj
QAtom
QComposite
QCompositeN
QMultiComposite
```

For the atomic operators we have 
```@docs
QTerm
QAbstract
```

For composite operators we have
```@docs
QAtomProduct
QCompositeProduct
QSum
QExp 
QLog
QPower
QRoot
```
and for multi composites
```@docs 
QCommutator
QCompositeProduct
```


Finally we have quantum expressions that are constructed as linear combinations of composite operators and differential equations in time \( d/dt \langle \text{Op} \rangle \) which define the time derivative (of the expectation value) of a composite operator as a quantum expression
```@docs
QExpr
diff_QEq
```

## QObj Construction 

Quantum expressions can be constructed via 
```@docs
term
base_operators
Sum
âˆ‘
d_dt
``` 
## QObj Modification
General modifications of quantum objectscan be performed with
```@docs
flatten
neq
QAlgebra.QExpressions.simplify
QAlgebra.QExpressions.substitute
QAlgebra.QExpressions.reorder!
```

## QObj Checks and Properties
The following scripts perform basic checks on the quantum expressions
```@docs
QAlgebra.QExpressions.is_numeric
QAlgebra.QExpressions.contains_abstract
QAlgebra.QExpressions.which_ensemble_acting
QAlgebra.QExpressions.are_indexes_defined
```

##  Printing and Output Formatting
```@docs
string
latex_string
```

Pretty-printing happens automatically when using `display` or `println` in environments like Jupyter or Pluto.

## 4. Algebraic Operations
We overload the most common algebraic operations, such as `+`, `*`, `-`, and `/`, to work with our introduced types. We furthermore add the following functions:
```@docs
Dag
Commutator
```

You can also construct commutators using vector notation:

```julia
A = alpha * xi
B = beta * yi
comm = A + [A, B]  # appends the commutator [A, B] to expression A
```
